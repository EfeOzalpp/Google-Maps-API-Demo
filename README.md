## 📍 Google Map API Demo
### 🗺️ Scenario
Imagine landing in a new city — exciting, disorienting, and perhaps a little intimidating.  
This app provides a **real, unfiltered overview** of the city’s vibe, based on what others are uploading at their current geolocation up for 24 hours.  
Expect to find authentic moments: local events, restaurants promoting their food, city landmarks, beautiful sunsets, and the occasional quirky photos — all live, and anonymous.

### 🎯 Why It Matters
Live Map offers a **crowd-sourced pulse of a place**, helping people feel connected and oriented in unfamiliar spaces.

### ⚠️ Known Issues
The **Geolocation API** and **IP-based lookup** can be unreliable in certain environments.  
Because some networks dynamically assign IP addresses, the app may occasionally **resolve users to incorrect or changing locations**, causing inconsistencies or inaccessible map regions for some users.
