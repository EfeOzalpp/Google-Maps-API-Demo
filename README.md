### Why It Matters
Live Map offers a **crowd-sourced pulse of a place**, helping people connect, coordinate, and stay oriented during unusual or live local events.  
It has no profiles or feeds, just a real-time snapshot of activity tied to each photo’s location.  
For unprecedented situations or events that require greater spatial awareness, geolocated images and captions.

### Known Issues
The **Geolocation API** and **IP-based lookup** can be unreliable in certain environments.  
Because some networks dynamically assign IP addresses, the app may occasionally **resolve users to incorrect or changing locations**, leading to inconsistent map data or inaccessible regions.
