## 📍 Google Maps API Demo

### Why It Matters
Live Map offers a **crowd-sourced pulse of a place**, helping people connect, coordinate, and stay oriented during unusual or live local events.  
It’s **not a social media platform** — there are no profiles or feeds — just a real-time still of what’s happening, tied directly to location when the photo was taken.
In unprecedented situations or events requiring greater spatial awareness, geolocated images and captions can provide help.

### Known Issues
The **Geolocation API** and **IP-based lookup** can be unreliable in certain environments.  
Because some networks dynamically assign IP addresses, the app may occasionally **resolve users to incorrect or changing locations**, leading to inconsistent map data or inaccessible regions.
